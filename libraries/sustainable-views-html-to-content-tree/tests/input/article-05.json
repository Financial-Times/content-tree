Today, The Guardian is running </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/29/deal-to-keep-15c-hopes-alive-is-within-reach-says-cop28-president\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an interview </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with Jaber, in which he claims an “unprecedented outcome” that would keep alive hopes of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C is within reach at the climate summit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What any of this means in reality is anyone's guess.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many climate experts believe the whole COP process is unfit for purpose and needs a thorough overhaul.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phyllis Cuttino from the Climate Reality Project, a US non-profit led by former vice-president Al Gore, is one of those calling for “reforms to the process”. These changes should include “a robust conflict of interest policy, added transparency and decision-making by super majority”, she tells me. We'll be running a full interview with Cuttino in the coming days.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a </span><a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/climate-action-can-be-a-great-unifier-if-we-put-it-in-motion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">comment piece</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Sustainable Views, Mahmoud Mohieldin, the UN climate change high-level champion for COP27, and Razan Al Mubarak, COP28's high-level champion, argue the process needs to give a louder voice to individuals on the frontlines of climate change, including indigenous peoples.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, UK campaigning organisation Uplift is warning that western governments should think twice before pointing fingers about any country's oil and gas plans. “The five countries responsible for over half of the world&#8217;s planned oil and gasfield developments from now until 2050 are the US, Canada, Norway, Australia and the UK,” says Tessa Khan, Uplift's executive director.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Away from high-level headlines, regulators and standards bodies continue to push on with the less attention-grabbing, but vitally important work of actually ensuring the energy transition can move forward and be financed, while not undermining businesses and jobs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this in mind, Alex </span><a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/fca-adds-extra-label-to-finalised-sustainability-disclosure-requirements/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brings us the lowdown</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the publication yesterday of the UK Financial Conduct Authority's long-awaited policy statement on its Sustainability Disclosure Requirements regime and the addition of a “sustainability mixed goals” label, while Natasha looks at the </span><a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/esg-standard-setters-launch-best-practice-platform-in-singapore/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best practice platform</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> launched in Singapore by the International Sustainability Standards Board and the Global Reporting Initiative.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, I report from the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group's 2023 annual conference in Brussels where EU financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness and European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde insisted </span><a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/christine-lagarde-sustainability-reporting-should-be-at-the-heart-of-company-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nitty-gritty sustainability reporting is literally changing the world</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The financial system and the corporate world are key to achieving societal goals. Even when we are overburdened, we should stand tall and carry on with our work,” said McGuinness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Words to keep in mind, perhaps, if the COP28 rollercoaster ride is also making you feel slightly queasy.</span></p>\n<p>Until tomorrow,</p>\n<p>Philippa</p>\n<p><em>Philippa Nuttall is the deputy editor of Sustainable Views</em></p>\n"
