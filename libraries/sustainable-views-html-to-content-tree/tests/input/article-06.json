		"body": "<h2>Even smaller companies, not immediately subject to the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, are feeling the pressure to disclose information about the impact of their activities on people and the environment. Many are concerned about the administrative burden. But the head of the ECB insists there will be advantages for the climate and businesses</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The main outcome of EU sustainability reporting and disclosure regulations should not be to<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"></span>“make consultants filthy rich”, says Véronique Willems, secretary-general of SMEunited, an organisation representing small and medium-sized companies from across Europe.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Willems did not mince her words as she took the floor at the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group's 2023 annual conference in Brussels. Smaller companies are focused on “action, not reporting on actions”, she said. “They want to do something about climate change and not invest all their resources in reporting.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Schroders head of public policy Europe Elisabeth Ottawa, in a similar vein, called out the increasing amount of EU sustainability regulation for “stifling innovation” at the recent Investment Management Forum hosted by the European Fund and Asset Management Association in Brussels.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Regulation has sucked the air out of the room,” Ottawa claimed. The focus on is it has become an obsession at the expense of “developing thoughtful investment strategies”, she said. “Regulation should be something we adhere to, rather than sets the agenda.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Everyone should be aware that companies are “on a<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> sustainability </span>journey” and that everything will not be perfect from day one, Willems said. “[SMEs] need a signal they will get time to comply. We are creating lots of unrest and even panic among small companies.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Some big companies” are suggesting smaller companies in their supply chains will be “out” if they cannot manage to fulfil reporting demands in the first instance, she continued.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To help companies with their reporting, the necessary datasets need to be available, businesses need to know what is expected of them, templates should be easy to fill in, and there should be links between the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and existing obligations to reduce the time spent on compliance and avoid double reporting, said Willems. She also urged the use of tools that are “already out there” and for companies to avoid “reinventing the wheel”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Building on her comment about consultants, Willems said “the number of professionals qualified to do sustainability reporting is very small”. Not only does the number of “qualified and affordable professionals” need to increase, but she also called for in-house “capacity building for SMEs”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This “capacity building” should involve “awareness raising and training”, said Willems, calling on the European Commission “to take a bit of responsibility” for this — “since you are putting the legislation in the market, we will be coming to you”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Financial reporting took decades to get close to harmonised systems,” said Luc Vansteenkiste, a member of Efrag's sustainability reporting board and chair of EuropeanIssuers, a business organisation. For sustainability reporting, similar results were trying to be achieved in a “very short amount of time”, he said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Many in the finance industry are concerned that few experts, from auditors to asset managers, have “the skills to make a correct judgment about what companies will propose as risk and the solutions for those risks”, said Vansteenkiste. Such decisions may be “very highly technical”, and people will have to quickly build up knowledge, he added.</p>\n<h3>Saving the planet</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">International Sustainability Standards Board chair Emmanuel Faber insisted that the ISSB is working to find ways to “reduce the administrative burden for reporting”, and highlighted its openness to incorporating existing standards into its work.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“There is urgency for an ecologically just transition,” said Faber. He expressed hope that the CSRD will be “used in a strategic manner” and will encourage business models that can “save the planet and maybe also save businesses”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">EU financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness likewise suggested sustainability requirements were not just good for the climate or nature, but also for company survival and success.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“What we are involved in is groundbreaking, we cannot go backwards, we must move forwards,” said McGuinness. “We want companies to be profitable and successful, and financial reporting goes hand in hand with this objective. Companies that want to stay successful also need to be sustainable.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To ensure reporting standards are a success in all senses of the word, they must be mandatory and tread the “delicate balance” of being “reasonable” for companies, while “keeping environmental ambitions high”, she said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">McGuinness called on everyone — from auditors to civil society — to “work together” to ensure EU sustainability reporting rules are implemented &#8220;effectively, in full and on time”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She pointed to the <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/in-charts-how-companies-are-gearing-up-for-csrd-reporting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">longer lead-in time</a> smaller companies have to meet the CSRD's European Sustainability Reporting Standards, and the <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/csrd-under-attack-as-eu-gears-up-for-elections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent changes</a> to EU's definition of SMEs. “We don't want smaller companies to be unduly burdened,” she said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">McGuinness singled out sector-specific standards, <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/csrd-under-attack-as-eu-gears-up-for-elections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">due now to be adopted</a> in June 2026, as important. “[These] standards should be proportionate and based on key information in each sector,” she said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But Sebastien Godinot, a member of the Efrag administrative board and finance expert at the World Wide Fund for Nature's European policy office, questioned the recent decision to delay EU sector-specific standards and guidelines, comparing the EU's take with the UK Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, which, he said, had taken only two weeks to deliver sector-specific sector guidance.</p>\n<h3>Digital dreaming</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, Efrag senior manager for digital reporting Richard Boessen underlined the advantages he believes will come with digitalising reporting. “Let's implement truly digital reporting and get rid of paper,” he said, though he admitted it may be a while before this “dream comes true”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">John Turner, international chief executive of XBRL, a consortium managing technical specifications for the digitalisation of compliance reports, insisted that even once digitalisation becomes reality, “management needs to stay in control of this process”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Artificial intelligence “will accelerate, improve and enhance” reporting, Turner said, but he suggested that without human input, digital tagging will not be 100 per cent right, with AI requiring &#8220;structured data” to work well.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Digitalisation will help end the practice of “sister standards” and help allow proper comparability across different jurisdictions, he added.</p>\n<h3>Achieving societal goals</h3>\n<p>Both McGuinness and European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde, who joined the Efrag event by video link, insisted the work being done on sustainability reporting is vital and its impacts will be felt way beyond the financial sector.</p>\n<p>“This work matters hugely to those who are alive today and those yet to be born,” said McGuinness. “Young people are less optimistic about the future and I hope our work gives them a reason to be hopeful, [to show] that the world has cottoned on and that balance and circularity are the future.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Businesses are not just reporting, they are “changing mindsets”, she said. “The financial system and the corporate world are key to achieving societal goals. Even when we are overburdened, we should stand tall and carry on with our work.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Lagarde urged companies and the financial sector to “transcend silos and fully integrate” sustainability reporting into regular financial reporting.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sustainability reporting is “not a supplementary component, it is a fundamental driver of value creation and risk management and should be at the heart of corporate decision-making”, Lagarde insisted. By creating a “sustainable and transparent corporate landscape, we are meeting the needs of the present and ensuring that future generations can meet their own needs”.</p>\n"
