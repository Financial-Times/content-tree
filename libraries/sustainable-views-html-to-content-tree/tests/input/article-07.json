		"body": "<h2>With climate action seemingly failing to meet the Paris Agreement's 1.5C target, we need to focus collectively on transformative solutions that will secure greater stability, security and equality for all</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a world overwhelmed by crises and fragmentation, we need to look at climate action as a unifying thread leading to a healthier, safer, more equitable future for all.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sooner we tackle climate change, the further we will go to develop sustainably and overcome food insecurity, the loss of natural resources such as land and water, social inequalities, mounting national debts and other crises.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is easy to focus on how climate action is failing to meet the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C. While developing countries struggle to access finance, technology and capacity-building, climate change impacts are intensifying - </span><a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/earth-had-hottest-three-month-period-record-unprecedented-sea-surface\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">record-shattering </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heat in 2023</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, deadly storms in Central America, east Asia and China, a year-long drought in Africa, and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staying within 1.5C requires us to halve emissions, build adaptation and resilience and end nature loss by 2030, and reach net zero emissions by 2050.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, a lot has changed since the 2015 Paris Agreement set a framework through which countries assess progress and ramp up action. The UN's COP26 climate conference in the UK in 2021 strengthened collaboration across the public and private sectors, and COP27 in Egypt in 2022 bridged the divide between climate and sustainable development work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We begin the COP28 conference in the United Arab Emirates, from November 30, with a solid foundation from which to spearhead an inclusive and just transition. This is the moment for national and local governments, businesses, financiers, civil society, youth and marginalised communities to accelerate the implementation of solutions between now and 2030.</span></p>\n<h3>A shift in solutions</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, the process must give a voice to people on the frontlines of climate change, including the indigenous peoples who protect 80 per cent of biodiversity, the farmers who produce the food on our tables, and the women who are responsible for feeding their families. Specifically, it requires a shift in three transformative solutions, in line with the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UAE presidency's <a href=\"https://www.cop28.com/letter-to-parties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stated </a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vision</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first is to provide and mobilise accessible, affordable finance at scale. For developing countries that are most in need of investment, the current global financial architecture is inefficient, insufficient and unfair.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developed countries must fulfil their pledge to mobilise $100bn a year through to 2025, as the past failure to do so has eroded trust. This is a first step towards reaching the $1tn a year of external finance that emerging markets and developing economies (excluding China) need by 2030, as <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/publication/finance-for-climate-action-scaling-up-investment-for-climate-and-development/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">projected</a> by the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Progress is afoot. The UAE in September pledged $4.5bn for climate projects in Africa - now we need a platform to distribute that finance. Over the past two years, the UN climate change high-level champions have worked with the COP27 and COP28 presidencies and UN Regional Commissions to <a href=\"https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/R20-Assets-to-flows-compressed-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">showcase </a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than 400 investable projects</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in developing countries, and match their developers with investors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Egypt, the government's </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green Smart Projects initiative</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is shoring up investments in grassroots, practical solutions at the local level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second solution is to fast-track a just, equitable transition to clean energy. Reaching net zero emissions requires us to <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/the-path-to-limiting-global-warming-to-1-5-c-has-narrowed-but-clean-energy-growth-is-keeping-it-open\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">triple</a> renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030, says the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International Energy Agency</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This action should go hand in hand with providing access to reliable, affordable and clean energy to the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">760mn people</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who still lack it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stronger, more targeted collaboration between high-emitting sectors would make this transition faster, easier and cheaper, shows a </span><a href=\"https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/breakthrough-agenda-report-2023-stronger-international-cooperation-in-high-emissions-sectors-crucial-to-get-on-track-for-1-5c-climate-goal/?gclid=CjwKCAiA0syqBhBxEiwAeNx9NxZn4-WsI4SbxSXIPJ21IbASa1df5ulbOCq6wTK3wdlG-UJbWV4cgxoCYq4QAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the IEA, the International Renewable Energy Agency and the high-level champions. Green hydrogen also needs to be turbocharged as an alternative fuel for heavy industry and transport. Africa's solar power, for example, could produce 50mn tonnes of green hydrogen by 2035 with €1tn of investment, creating jobs and boosting national gross domestic product, <a href=\"https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2022-574-new-study-confirms-eur-1-trillion-africa-s-extraordinary-green-hydrogen-potential\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">says</a> the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">European Investment Bank</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third transformative solution is to put nature, people and livelihoods at the heart of climate action and sustainable development. Nature-based solutions already capture half of today's anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and could provide one-third of the necessary emissions reductions by 2030, while also enhancing adaptation and resilience. Half of global GDP is estimated to be directly or indirectly linked to nature.</span></p>\n<h3>Reverse deforestation</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 2021 </span><a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20230418175226/https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pledge </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by 100 countries</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 brought the climate and nature agendas closer together. The “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharm El-Sheikh adaptation agenda</span>”<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <a href=\"https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SeS-Adaptation-Agenda_Complete-Report-COP27_FINAL-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">launched</a> in 2022, set the first targets for building adaptation and enabling planning and finance across key areas - including for food, water and oceans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">COP28 can build on this momentum by leveraging the benefits of nature-positive business for climate action and sustainable development, and strengthening engagement from the private sector, governments and civil society.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By advancing action on these three fronts, we will begin to break a spiral in which climate change impacts exacerbate global crises, and crises accelerate climate change. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sooner we seize on climate action as a global unifier, the faster we will secure greater stability, security and equality for all.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mahmoud Mohieldin was the UN climate change high-level champion for COP27, and Razan Al Mubarak is the UN climate change high-level champion for COP28</span></i></p>\n"
