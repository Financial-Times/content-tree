    "body": "<h2>As the latest climate summit starts in Dubai, there are ongoing doubts that a petrostate can move the world from accords to actions in line with the emissions trajectory demanded by the Paris Agreement</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">COP28 president Sultan al-Jaber has stoutly denied the allegations that documents leaked earlier this week indicated his intention to use the United Arab Emirate's role at the climate summit to push oil and gas deals with foreign governments.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“These allegations are false,” Jaber told journalists in Dubai just hours before COP28 opened. “Not true, incorrect, not accurate.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He suggested the <a href=\"https://climate-reporting.org/cop28-president-oil-climate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports</a> were “an attempt to undermine the work of the COP28 presidency”, and appeared indignant that anyone would suppose the UAE needed any help with deal-brokering.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Do you think the UAE or myself needs the COP or the COP presidency to go and establish better deals or commercial relationships?” asked Jaber. “No one in this world had been able to master win-win relationships and fruitful and production partnerships like this country.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In a statement, he doubled down on promises to deliver on climate, insisting: “We don't have any time to waste. We need to take urgent action now to reduce emissions. At COP28, every country and every company will be held to account, guided by the north star of keeping 1.5C within reach.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“All parties should be prepared to deliver a high-ambition decision in response to the global stocktake that reduces emissions while protecting people, lives and livelihoods,” Jaber added.</p>\n<h3>Shipping and deforestation</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">US climate envoy John Kerry said the global stocktake, which will take place during the climate summit to reveal where the world is, and not, making progress to cut emissions, could be used to get countries to “significantly step up” to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The global stocktake needs to earn the credibility of the world by being “candid and strong and visionary and comprehensive,” he told journalists in Dubai.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If emissions-cutting promises made since Paris were fulfilled, “things could be in grasp”, said Kerry, but added that “not everyone was doing what they promised to do; we need to have accountability for that lack of follow through”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Kerry singled out action on methane from oil and gas companies and countries as one area where there would be progress at COP28. China and the US have pledged to hold a summit on methane during the summit. Taking action on methane is the “easiest, quickest, fastest way to begin to get gains against the warming”, said Kerry.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He also named shipping, heavy industry and deforestation as other areas of focus at the summit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Finance for mitigation and adaption would be likewise high on the agenda, said Kerry, suggesting that advances could be made “thanks to changes at the World Bank and &#8220;literally hundreds of initiatives&#8221; that will be announced on financing to move forward the global transition.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">“COP28 cannot be just a photo-op,” said UN Framework Convention onClimate Change executive secretary Simon Stiell in a statement. “The reality is that without much more finance flowing to developing countries, a renewables revolution will remain a mirage in the desert. COP28 must turn it into a reality,” he said.</p>\n<p>Kerry insisted there would be “progress” at COP28. “The question is, how much progress.”</p>\n<h3>Calls for reform</h3>\n<p class=\"p3\">But many non-profits believe that the COP process needs a thorough overall if is to genuinely achieve ambitious climate action in line with 1.5C and ensure finance flows shift from fossil fuels to cleaner technologies.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Phyllis Cuttino, chief executive ofthe Climate Reality Project, a US non-profit led by former vice-president Al Gore, would like to see the UNFCCC introduce “a robust conflict of interest policy, added transparency and decision-making by super majority” as part of the COP process.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Whether the reports about the UAE potentially using COP for oil and gas deals are true or not, Cuttino says the issue of “conflicts of interest” is a problem at COP28 and most in need of attention.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The COP president sets the agenda and is critical in all the negotiations,” she tells Sustainable Views, hence the incongruence of “one of the largest oil companies in the world” leading a climate summit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As for the place of fossil fuel companies at COPs, “we are not saying that they can't attend, but they should be clearly identified as being from the fossil fuel industry and not be hiding in delegations”. Twenty-nine countries brought a total of 200 fossil fuel lobbyists to COP27 in Egypt in 2022 as part of their official delegations, according to a report by non-profit Global Witness.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Club of Rome think-tank and other non-profits are also coming forward with proposals to reform the COP process. The demands from the Club of Rome include calls for COPs to be based on science, for more regular, smaller meetings, and for multilateral banks and financial institutions to have a “central role in working sessions to ensure pledges become tangible, deliverable work plans”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Despite the controversies dogging the climate summit, Cuttino believes there can be progress, but adds: &#8220;At the end of the day, it is challenging to see how you get to really addressing the root cause of climate change if you can't address the root cause, namely fossil fuels.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There is growing momentum, nonetheless, among businesses for a phase-out of the use of fossil fuels that do not use carbon capture and storage, so-called unabated fossil fuels.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">More than 200 companies representing over $1.5tn in global annual revenue are signed up to the campaign by non-profit We Mean Business, urging national governments at COP28 “to seek outcomes that will lay the groundwork to transform the global energy system towards a full phase-out of unabated fossil fuels”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The companies supporting the call to phase out the use of oil, coal and gas without carbon capture and storage, cover a range of sectors and include Sony, Roche, DHL, Coca-Cola, Danone, Nestlé and Unilever.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Kerry said the US would continue to “support language” around a phase-out of unabated fossil fuels: “I find it hard for anyone to continue the unabated burning of fossil fuels in the world in which we live,” he added.</p>\n"

    "body": "<h2>Trade will have its own day at COP28, but experts are unconvinced discussions will focus on answering the thorny questions that will have to be tackled if the global trade in goods is to genuinely boost climate action and help bring down emissions</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Trade is part of the solution to the climate crisis,” said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the World Trade Organization, as she unveiled plans in October 2023 for a trade pavilion at COP28.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Okonjo-Iweala has been vocal about her belief in the synergies between trade and climate action since she was appointed to lead the WTO in 2021, and for the first time at a climate conference, COP28 will dedicate a day to the role of trade in the energy transition.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Marc Vanheukelen, former EU climate ambassador, EU WTO ambassador and trade director at the European Commission, has a list of subjects he “hopes” will be discussed around trade at COP28, but “I don't harbour too many illusions”, he says.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“There is lots of discussion about how trade should become more instrumental in helping the fight against climate change,” Vanheukelen tells Sustainable Views. “But I think it is fair to say that until now all this has stayed fairly general and I am afraid COP28 will be more of the same.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He singles out three issues he believes should be on the COP28 agenda.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">First up is a call for a discussion about how tariffs could be removed from environmental goods to facilitate the dissemination of clean tech products.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We tried in 2016 with the Environmental Goods Agreement, but it fell flat,” says Vanheukelen. “I haven't seen any real attempt to get this off the ground again.” There is also the thorny question of what exactly constitutes an environmental good, he notes.</p>\n<p>Figures published by the UN Conference on Trade and Development in March 2023 show that trade in “environmentally friendly goods”, defined as products designed to use fewer resources or cause less pollution, such as electric vehicles, non-plastic packaging and wind turbines, grew by around 4 per cent in the second half of 2022, reaching a record $1.9tn.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The second issue Vanheukelen lists is that which the EU is trying to engage with through its <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/how-cbam-will-change-the-world-is-uncertain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">carbon border adjustment mechanism</a>, whereby the same product, like steel, is treated differently when traded because of the way it is produced. The ability to discriminate in this way is “not really allowed by the current multilateral trade book”, he says.</p>\n<p>Vanheukelen is optimistic about the potential for the CBAM to bring about change. “I think it has been carefully crafted and I think there is a very fair chance it will be considered WTO compatible as it doesn't discriminate between domestic and foreign producers,” he says. Further, “one of the intentions of CBAM is that it is imitated elsewhere”, he adds. Indeed, the UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced the introduction of a UK CBAM in this week's Autumn Statement.</p>\n<h3>Subsidised solar panels</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Vanheukelen's third ask for COP28 is for a discussion on “environmentally helpful and harmful subsidies”. He cites the 1994 WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, which was designed to reign in government “beggar-thy-neighbour” public financing schemes. But, he continues, the ASCM was not designed with climate change in mind and does not allow for the fact that environmentally helpful subsidies in one country can scale up clean technology, make it cheaper and thereby benefit the rest of the world.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It is, in part, because China heavily subsidised solar panels that we have so many solar panels on European and American rooftops,” says Vanheukelen.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yet, such a stance is unlikely to garner much favour from EU officials, who are desperately focused on trying to create a “made in Europe” energy transition and are deeply concerned that the EU's loss of its solar industry could be repeated for other clean technologies.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ten years ago, the EU imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures on imports of solar panels from China after seeing the devastating impacts on Europe's solar industry from cheaper imports.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In September 2023, the European Commission launched an investigation into whether to impose punitive tariffs to protect EU electric vehicle producers against cheaper Chinese imports it says are benefiting from state subsidies. The commission is also scrutinising foreign subsidies as part of a broader swathe of action to support the EU wind industry.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported last week that France has signalled it would agree to delay the introduction of tariffs on electric vehicle sales between the UK and EU, which were due to come into effect in January. Some EU countries are concerned that any void left by the UK would be filled by Chinese cars, with impacts on EU competitiveness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>It is, in part, because China heavily subsidised solar panels that we have so many solar panels on European and American rooftops</h2>\n<h4>Marc Vanheukelen, former EU climate ambassador</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Vanheukelen describes the need to reduce emissions, while creating jobs and growth in new industries as “a very difficult and delicate balancing exercise”. He says: “This is not only about fighting climate change, it is also about who has a leading edge in the fourth industrial revolution.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In this sense, “industrial policy and climate policy” are “uneasy bed fellows”, he says, expressing empathy for EU manufacturers who are struggling, but insists again on the potential global benefits.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The WTO is the place for a wider discussion on this subject, says Vanheukelen. He underlines the need for “disciplines” on environmental subsidies — they should not be allowed to be used as “an alibi to wipe out the industry of others”. But he insists the differences between environmentally helpful and harmful subsidies and how to deal with them should be up for discussion.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Regarding harmful subsidies, he cites the <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/fossil-fuel-subsidies-hit-record-7tn-says-imf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data</a> published by the International Monetary Fund in August 2023, which shows that fossil fuel subsidies reached $7tn in 2022, equivalent to 7.1 per cent of global gross domestic product. “Explicit subsidies (undercharging for supply costs) have more than doubled since 2020 but are still only 18 per cent of the total subsidy, while nearly 60 per cent is due to undercharging for global warming and local air pollution,” says the IMF.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The ASCM has a list of prohibited subsidies,” says Vanheukelen, suggesting this should perhaps be enlarged to include subsidies to fossil fuels to “tell the world that in seven or 10 years, subsides for the production and consumption of fossil fuels should be outlawed”.</p>\n<h3>Wrong diagnosis</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The incorporation of trade angles in the climate conversation is valuable and overdue,” Tom Wills, managing director of UK non-profit Trade Justice Movement, tells Sustainable Views. “We are very pleased to see this trade and climate day at COP.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Wills says he is “anxious,” however, that while “the focus is right, the diagnosis is wrong”. He adds: “The global trading system is designed to increase production, consumption and to lower barriers to trade, and it seems that the response to the climate emergency is to follow roughly the same path with some small tweaks. It is great we are talking about trade but we need to change the conversation.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At COP28, Wills would like to see a discussion around how the rules governing technology transfer and IP protection can be changed to enable countries and companies in the global south to develop their own clean technologies rather than having to buy from corporates in the global north.</p>\n<p>He would also like more focus on what initiatives like the CBAM will mean for poorer countries. “Anything that brings global emissions down is positive, but we are concerned this approach will disproportionately punish countries in the global south that have not had the investment historically to develop non-carbon-intensive technologies,” he says.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>It is great we are talking about trade but we need to change the conversation</h2>\n<h4>Tom Wills, Trade Justice Movement</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In a <a href=\"https://www.tjm.org.uk/blog/autumn-statement-carbon-tax-could-threaten-developing-country-economies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a>, timed to be released as UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced his Autumn Statement, the Trade Justice Movement calls for some developing countries to be exempt from the scope of a UK CBAM scheme or to be given long transition periods.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“We don't propose that this adds up to a free pass for poorer countries to just continue to follow polluting industrial policies, but without support, investment and transition periods we think it is unlikely that these countries will just magically start producing clearer goods,” Wills explains.</p>\n<p>Vanheukelen says that with direct foreign investment or technology transfers to these countries, “producers in third countries that are exporting to the EU will have an incentive to change”.</p>\n<h3>Is ISDS needed?</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Wills' third wish for the COP28 agenda is the much-maligned investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, which environmental campaigners have insisted for years allows big corporates to undermine policies aimed at reducing emissions or protecting nature.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The most-criticised body in this system is the Energy Charter Treaty, which Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Poland have all announced plans to withdraw from because of its incompatibility with the Paris Agreement, and the UK is expected to announce its decision on whether to stay or leave the ECT later this month.</p>\n<p class=\"dcr-1kas69x\">The Guardian reported last week that Klesch Group Holdings Limited, a Jersey-based oil-refining company, is using the ECT to sue the EU, Germany and Denmark for at least €95mn over a windfall tax introduced during the Ukraine war that it sees as a “pretext” for undermining fossil fuel companies.</p>\n<p>While many believe the ECT may be tottering towards its end, it “is just one part of a global structure”, says Wills. “We need to dismantle the ISDS system wholesale.”</p>\n<p>A briefing published ahead of COP28 by the International Institute for Environment and Development and the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment shows fossil fuel businesses have been awarded more than $80bn of taxpayers' money through ISDS since the first case was brought in 1977.</p>\n<p>Vanheukelen's stance on the issue is less radical. “ISDS should not unduly constrain the policy space of countries and should be modernised,” he says. “But we need it otherwise many companies will hesitate to invest, especially in third countries that are not well known for an independent judiciary. ISDS gives them the possibility of international arbitration.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A final call from Wills is for free trade agreements to include “strong binding commitments on the environment and climate”. Analysis by the UK government on the recent FTA between the UK and New Zealand estimates the deal will lead to an increase of “around 50 per cent in transport emissions associated with trade with New Zealand”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While trade reform per se to genuinely boost the energy transition may be slow going, Vanheukelen believes that EU policies such as the recent EU anti-deforestation law that will ban products from areas linked to the destruction of forests, will have an impact on trade globally.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The EU is using more and more access to the internal market as a normative lever to promote sustainability worldwide,” he says. “It is a powerful instrument, but it does not make us friends all over the world.”</p>\n"

One hundred and fifty countries have signed up to the EU-led <a href=\"https://www.globalmethanepledge.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Global Methane Pledge</a> since it was established in 2021, but few have outlined how they will achieve the target of reducing methane emissions from all sources by 30 per cent from 2020 levels by 2030.</p>\n<p>COP28 organiser the UAE has called on the oil and gas industry to phase out methane emissions by 2030, but methane emissions from coal need just as much attention as those from oil and gas, says the <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/urgent-action-to-cut-methane-emissions-from-fossil-fuel-operations-essential-to-achieve-global-climate-targets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IEA</a>. And despite committing to end the polluting practice of burning excess methane 20 years ago, the UAE has continued almost daily flaring, shows data from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.</p>\n<p>Ahead of COP28, the US and China met to discuss a methane summit that will form part of the conference. The two countries have <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/sunnylands-statement-on-enhancing-cooperation-to-address-the-climate-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">agreed to</a> include methane in their next greenhouse gas emission targets, following the publication of China&#8217;s long-awaited methane emissions plan in November. China, which has not joined the Global Methane Pledge, is responsible for 10 per cent of global human-caused methane emissions with 40 per cent of the country&#8217;s emissions coming from coal mining.</p>\n<h3>Emissions falling</h3>\n<p>Indeed, this continuing reliance on coal is hampering efforts to reduce emissions globally.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Germany's overall greenhouse gas emissions fell by almost </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2 per cent</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2022, according to official <a href=\"https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/presse/pressemitteilungen/uba-prognose-treibhausgasemissionen-sanken-2022-um\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">figures</a>, but they will need to fall by 6 per cent annually to reach the government's goal of reducing emissions by 65 per cent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Our studies have shown that Germany can and should stop relying on coal for power generation,” David Pfeiffer, scientific adviser at the German Environment Agency's Department of Climate Protection and Energy, tells Sustainable Views. “A coal-fired power plant emits two to three times as much CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh as a natural gas-fired power plant.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UK's independent Climate Change Committee found that emissions have fallen over the past decade at an average rate of</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.2 per cent</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a year, but in 2022 they ticked up by 0.8 per cent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A spokesperson for the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero tells Sustainable Views that “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by next year, we will be one of the first major economies with power that is coal-free”, but</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the CCC is nonetheless concerned.

More than 80 per cent of European habitats are deemed to be in poor shape.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The final step is for the law to be rubber-stamped by the parliament in plenary, a vote likely to take place in February 2024.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Industrial Emissions Directive</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Some green groups were, however, less enthusiastic about the decision reached by the European Commission, parliament and national governments on the EU Industrial Emissions Directive and its application to agricultural pollution.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“The updated law will help guide industrial investments necessary for Europe's transformation towards a cleaner, carbon neutral, more circular and competitive economy by 2050,” the commission said in a statement.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“It willspur innovation, reward frontrunners and help level the playing field on the EU market,and increaselong-term investment certainty for industry,” it added.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The revised law will also cover installations used for the extraction of metals and large-scale production of batteries, and the largest pig and poultry farms, though the inclusion of cattle farms will only be assessed at a later stage. Farms covered by the law will benefit from a lighter permitting regime than industrial installations.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The final deal also agrees the creation of an Innovation Centre for Industrial Transformation and Emissions to help industry identify “pollution control solutions and transformative technologies”, the commission said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, operators of industrial installations will need to develop transformation plans in line with the EU's 2050 net zero pollution, circular economy and decarbonisation goals.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Finally, the measures set out the penalties industrial installations will incur for breaking the law and opportunities for citizens to seek compensation.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On the exclusion of cattle farms, Greenpeace EU agriculture policy director Marco Contiero said in a statement: “You have to ask yourself why these politicians fought so hard to give the 1 per cent biggest cow factories, the absolute most polluting, a free pass. The European countryside is drowning in manure, and our clean air, fresh water and safe climate are going down the drain with it.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The deal now has to be formally approved by the European parliament and national ministers.</p>\n"

    "body": "<h2>Even smaller companies, not immediately subject to the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, are feeling the pressure to disclose information about the impact of their activities on people and the environment. Many are concerned about the administrative burden. But the head of the ECB insists there will be advantages for the climate and businesses</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The main outcome of EU sustainability reporting and disclosure regulations should not be to<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"></span>“make consultants filthy rich”, says Véronique Willems, secretary-general of SMEunited, an organisation representing small and medium-sized companies from across Europe.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Willems did not mince her words as she took the floor at the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group's 2023 annual conference in Brussels. Smaller companies are focused on “action, not reporting on actions”, she said. “They want to do something about climate change and not invest all their resources in reporting.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Schroders head of public policy Europe Elisabeth Ottawa, in a similar vein, called out the increasing amount of EU sustainability regulation for “stifling innovation” at the recent Investment Management Forum hosted by the European Fund and Asset Management Association in Brussels.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Regulation has sucked the air out of the room,” Ottawa claimed. The focus on is it has become an obsession at the expense of “developing thoughtful investment strategies”, she said. “Regulation should be something we adhere to, rather than sets the agenda.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Everyone should be aware that companies are “on a<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> sustainability </span>journey” and that everything will not be perfect from day one, Willems said. “[SMEs] need a signal they will get time to comply. We are creating lots of unrest and even panic among small companies.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Some big companies” are suggesting smaller companies in their supply chains will be “out” if they cannot manage to fulfil reporting demands in the first instance, she continued.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To help companies with their reporting, the necessary datasets need to be available, businesses need to know what is expected of them, templates should be easy to fill in, and there should be links between the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and existing obligations to reduce the time spent on compliance and avoid double reporting, said Willems. She also urged the use of tools that are “already out there” and for companies to avoid “reinventing the wheel”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Building on her comment about consultants, Willems said “the number of professionals qualified to do sustainability reporting is very small”. Not only does the number of “qualified and affordable professionals” need to increase, but she also called for in-house “capacity building for SMEs”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This “capacity building” should involve “awareness raising and training”, said Willems, calling on the European Commission “to take a bit of responsibility” for this — “since you are putting the legislation in the market, we will be coming to you”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“Financial reporting took decades to get close to harmonised systems,” said Luc Vansteenkiste, a member of Efrag's sustainability reporting board and chair of EuropeanIssuers, a business organisation. For sustainability reporting, similar results were trying to be achieved in a “very short amount of time”, he said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Many in the finance industry are concerned that few experts, from auditors to asset managers, have “the skills to make a correct judgment about what companies will propose as risk and the solutions for those risks”, said Vansteenkiste. Such decisions may be “very highly technical”, and people will have to quickly build up knowledge, he added.</p>\n<h3>Saving the planet</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">International Sustainability Standards Board chair Emmanuel Faber insisted that the ISSB is working to find ways to “reduce the administrative burden for reporting”, and highlighted its openness to incorporating existing standards into its work.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“There is urgency for an ecologically just transition,” said Faber. He expressed hope that the CSRD will be “used in a strategic manner” and will encourage business models that can “save the planet and maybe also save businesses”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">EU financial services commissioner Mairead McGuinness likewise suggested sustainability requirements were not just good for the climate or nature, but also for company survival and success.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">“What we are involved in is groundbreaking, we cannot go backwards, we must move forwards,” said McGuinness. “We want companies to be profitable and successful, and financial reporting goes hand in hand with this objective. Companies that want to stay successful also need to be sustainable.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To ensure reporting standards are a success in all senses of the word, they must be mandatory and tread the “delicate balance” of being “reasonable” for companies, while “keeping environmental ambitions high”, she said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">McGuinness called on everyone — from auditors to civil society — to “work together” to ensure EU sustainability reporting rules are implemented &#8220;effectively, in full and on time”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">She pointed to the <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/in-charts-how-companies-are-gearing-up-for-csrd-reporting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">longer lead-in time</a> smaller companies have to meet the CSRD's European Sustainability Reporting Standards, and the <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/csrd-under-attack-as-eu-gears-up-for-elections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent changes</a> to EU's definition of SMEs. “We don't want smaller companies to be unduly burdened,” she said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">McGuinness singled out sector-specific standards, <a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/csrd-under-attack-as-eu-gears-up-for-elections/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">due now to be adopted</a> in June 2026, as important. “[These] standards should be proportionate and based on key information in each sector,” she said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But Sebastien Godinot, a member of the Efrag administrative board and finance expert at the World Wide Fund for Nature's European policy office, questioned the recent decision to delay EU sector-specific standards and guidelines, comparing the EU's take with the UK Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, which, he said, had taken only two weeks to deliver sector-specific sector guidance.</p>\n<h3>Digital dreaming</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, Efrag senior manager for digital reporting Richard Boessen underlined the advantages he believes will come with digitalising reporting. “Let's implement truly digital reporting and get rid of paper,” he said, though he admitted it may be a while before this “dream comes true”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">John Turner, international chief executive of XBRL, a consortium managing technical specifications for the digitalisation of compliance reports, insisted that even once digitalisation becomes reality, “management needs to stay in control of this process”.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Artificial intelligence “will accelerate, improve and enhance” reporting, Turner said, but he suggested that without human input, digital tagging will not be 100 per cent right, with AI requiring &#8220;structured data” to work well.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Digitalisation will help end the practice of “sister standards” and help allow proper comparability across different jurisdictions, he added.</p>\n<h3>Achieving societal goals</h3>\n<p>Both McGuinness and European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde, who joined the Efrag event by video link, insisted the work being done on sustainability reporting is vital and its impacts will be felt way beyond the financial sector.</p>\n<p>“This work matters hugely to those who are alive today and those yet to be born,” said McGuinness. “Young people are less optimistic about the future and I hope our work gives them a reason to be hopeful, [to show] that the world has cottoned on and that balance and circularity are the future.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Businesses are not just reporting, they are “changing mindsets”, she said. “The financial system and the corporate world are key to achieving societal goals. Even when we are overburdened, we should stand tall and carry on with our work.”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Lagarde urged companies and the financial sector to “transcend silos and fully integrate” sustainability reporting into regular financial reporting.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sustainability reporting is “not a supplementary component, it is a fundamental driver of value creation and risk management and should be at the heart of corporate decision-making”, Lagarde insisted. By creating a “sustainable and transparent corporate landscape, we are meeting the needs of the present and ensuring that future generations can meet their own needs”.</p>\n"

The UN's COP26 climate conference in the UK in 2021 strengthened collaboration across the public and private sectors, and COP27 in Egypt in 2022 bridged the divide between climate and sustainable development work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We begin the COP28 conference in the United Arab Emirates, from November 30, with a solid foundation from which to spearhead an inclusive and just transition.

For developing countries that are most in need of investment, the current global financial architecture is inefficient, insufficient and unfair.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developed countries must fulfil their pledge to mobilise $100bn a year through to 2025, as the past failure to do so has eroded trust. This is a first step towards reaching the $1tn a year of external finance that emerging markets and developing economies (excluding China) need by 2030, as <a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/publication/finance-for-climate-action-scaling-up-investment-for-climate-and-development/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">projected</a> by the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Progress is afoot. The UAE in September pledged $4.5bn for climate projects in Africa - now we need a platform to distribute that finance. Over the past two years, the UN climate change high-level champions have worked with the COP27 and COP28 presidencies and UN Regional Commissions to <a href=\"https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/R20-Assets-to-flows-compressed-2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">showcase </a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than 400 investable projects</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in developing countries, and match their developers with investors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Egypt, the government's </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Green Smart Projects initiative</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is shoring up investments in grassroots, practical solutions at the local level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second solution is to fast-track a just, equitable transition to clean energy.

This action should go hand in hand with providing access to reliable, affordable and clean energy to the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">760mn people</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> who still lack it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stronger, more targeted collaboration between high-emitting sectors would make this transition faster, easier and cheaper, shows a </span><a href=\"https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/breakthrough-agenda-report-2023-stronger-international-cooperation-in-high-emissions-sectors-crucial-to-get-on-track-for-1-5c-climate-goal/?gclid=CjwKCAiA0syqBhBxEiwAeNx9NxZn4-WsI4SbxSXIPJ21IbASa1df5ulbOCq6wTK3wdlG-UJbWV4cgxoCYq4QAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the IEA, the International Renewable Energy Agency and the high-level champions. Green hydrogen also needs to be turbocharged as an alternative fuel for heavy industry and transport. Africa's solar power, for example, could produce 50mn tonnes of green hydrogen by 2035 with €1tn of investment, creating jobs and boosting national gross domestic product, <a href=\"https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2022-574-new-study-confirms-eur-1-trillion-africa-s-extraordinary-green-hydrogen-potential\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">says</a> the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">European Investment Bank</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The third transformative solution is to put nature, people and livelihoods at the heart of climate action and sustainable development. Nature-based solutions already capture half of today's anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and could provide one-third of the necessary emissions reductions by 2030, while also enhancing adaptation and resilience. Half of global GDP is estimated to be directly or indirectly linked to nature.</span></p>\n<h3>Reverse deforestation</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A 2021 </span><a href=\"https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20230418175226/https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pledge </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by 100 countries</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 brought the climate and nature agendas closer together.

    "body": "<h2>The International Sustainability Standards Board and the Global Reporting Initiative have launched a best practice platform in Singapore to help companies prepare for an increasing slew of sustainability requirements</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the alignment of sustainability disclosures now a global concern, two international standard setters are looking to Asia to facilitate this work. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On November 20, the International Sustainability Standards Board and the Global Reporting Initiative launched the Sustainability Innovation Lab in Singapore. The choice of southeast Asia</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was driven by the desire to fill the ESG reporting gap left by the region's rapid economic growth, coupled with its growing environmental challenges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I think Asia is more adapted to change,” GRI chief executive Eelco van der Enden said at a press briefing held at the SIL launch. “New economies are less traditionally focused, more flexible and more capable of dealing with change.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing regulatory requirements and sustainability reporting pressures by foreign investors were also cited as reasons to headquarter SIL in Singapore. The city-state is the region's finance hub and is responsible for more than 90 per cent of assets under management in southeast Asia, according to GRI.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We noticed that many professionals and suppliers are not fully ready and do not yet understand the transformation that is currently pending in global supply and value chains,” van der Enden said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SIL Asia aims to help companies with upcoming disclosure requirements that many are unprepared for, say van der Enden and ISSB chair Emmanuel Faber. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“For most legal professionals, sustainability reports are a new field,” said van der Enden, who suggested the same is true for “accountants providing assurance, or validating those reports”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GRI plans to leverage the Singapore government&#8217;s strong commitment for sustainability to “support the ambitious goal of SIL” as it grows beyond the region. “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are not here to reinvent new languages,” Faber said at the press briefing. “We are here to make sure we assemble those languages that [already] exist and that are working well into a format that moves the capital allocations into more resilient business models.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is where the cooperation with GRI started 18 months ago,” he added.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SIL is aiming for global reach, with an initial focus on Asia. Plans for representatives in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Japan are in the works, but there is no timetable yet for when this will happen.</span></p>\n<h3>Reducing reporting burdens</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faber listed some of the questions being posed around sustainability reporting requirements: “Here in Asia where GRI is used by many companies. How can you lower the costs for these companies that are using GRI today but may have to use ISSB in the near future because regulators are going to make it mandatory? How can companies best do that together?” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GRI is the most commonly used framework for sustainability reporting in Asia Pacific, with around 81 per cent of the top 50 listed companies across the region's 14 major jurisdictions using it as the dominant standard, according to a June 2023 study by consultants PwC. According to Faber: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is really what started the idea of the SIL - with capacity building, with working on taxonomies and understanding the mapping of the standards.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IFRS Foundation and GRI first announced their collaboration agreement in March 2023, under which their respective standard setting boards, the ISSB and the Global Sustainability Standards Board, would seek to streamline their standard-setting activities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The agreement followed public pleas from reporting entities in the region for a reduction in reporting burdens through better alignment of ISSB and GRI&#8217;s work programmes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“[The establishment of SIL] is a strong signal that first of all, there is no competition between ISSB and GRI - as people have said that one is going to push the other out of the market - we are perfectly complementary,” said van der Enden. “ And if we didn&#8217;t like each other, we wouldn&#8217;t be working together.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ISSB and GRI collaboration provides two pillars of international sustainability reporting - a first pillar representing investor-focused capital market standards, and the second pillar of GRI sustainability reporting requirements designed to meet multi-stakeholder needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We listened to the wishes of investors and the market. That is why we are not only looking at producing a framework to report on, but also trying to enhance basic knowledge and understanding of what it is to report on and how to report on it,” said van der Enden.</span></p>\n"

    "uuid": "3b1fb6eb-079c-4256-857f-06514f217175",
    "body": "<h2>The UK Financial Conduct Authority has added a fourth label to the SDR to account for funds that have 'mixed goals', and launched a consultation on its anti-greenwashing rules</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Financial Conduct Authority has added a “sustainability mixed goals” label to its Sustainability Disclosure Requirements regime, which will apply to funds that combine the attributes of its existing three sustainability labels of “focus”, “improvers” and “impact”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The regulator estimates that around 630 UK-based funds use sustainability-related terms, of which 45 per cent will use its investment labels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On November 28, the FCA </span><a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/sustainability-disclosure-and-labelling-regime-confirmed-fca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">published its long-awaited policy statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on SDR, which is designed to help retail investors understand funds' sustainability characteristics. It ran a consultation on the proposed regime from the end of 2022 until January, and the release of its policy statement has been delayed twice.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FCA created the new label after its consultation revealed concerns that funds with a spread of the characteristics carried by the original three categories would not fit neatly into any of these categories.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has also relaxed some of its naming and marketing rules, and has launched a consultation on anti-greenwashing rules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We welcome the attempt to impose guardrails and standards, while holding asset managers to account for the metrics that are actually used in bottom-up portfolio construction, rather than adding to the data reporting burden,” Iancu Daramus, Fulcrum Asset Management's head of sustainability, told Sustainable Views.</span></p>\n<h3>Label changes</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SDR regime comes into full effect in December 2024, but funds can start using the labels from July 2024. The regime applies solely to UK-based funds and, unlike Europe's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, the labels are not compulsory.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FCA has also made changes to the existing three categories. It received concerns about its “improvers” label, which would apply to funds aiming to improve the sustainability credentials of assets over time. Some respondents to the consultation suggested it would be difficult to prove a causal link between stewardship activities and asset improvements. Firms will now not have to show this link, the FCA said.<strong></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The regulator has also removed references to terms such as “engagement” and “voting”, which it accepted could imply a specific approach to stewardship.</span></p>\n<p>Paul Dennis, investment director at financial adviser Holden &amp; Partners, acknowledged the importance of introducing the mixed label, but said he feared that this “will now become the catch-all label,” with all potentially sustainable investments ending up in there. He had previously feared this would be the lot of the 'improvers' label.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FCA rejected requests to change the “impact” label - for investments into solutions to problems facing people or the planet - to “solutions”,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by respondents who said that all labels achieve a form of impact. References to “real-world impact” within the label's criteria have been removed, however, and the FCA also clarified that investments in public markets qualify under the label.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, queries were also asked about the planned “focus” label, under which investments were originally defined as having</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“a credible standard of environmental or social sustainability”. The FCA has now removed the term “credible” and refers, instead, to “a robust, evidence-based standard that is an absolute measure of sustainability”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally, this was the only label that carried a threshold demanding that at least 70 per cent of the gross value of a product's assets are invested in line with its objectives. Under</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the finalised rules, the 70 per cent minimum threshold applies across all four labels. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FCA pointed out that planned thresholds are higher in other jurisdictions, noting that the European Securities and Markets Authority and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have proposed an 80 per cent threshold for fund naming rules.</span></p>\n<h3>Marketing proposals were 'too constraining'</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FCA had proposed that products that do not use its labels would not be permitted to use sustainability-related terms in their names and marketing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The regulator acknowledged, however, that while a minority of respondents backed its proposals for the naming and marketing of funds, many viewed its approach, especially to marketing, “to be too constraining”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is relaxing its rules to allow firms to use terms relating to sustainability in their product names and marketing even if they do not use a label, provided that they meet certain conditions, such as carrying a statement to confirm that the product does not have a label and explain its absence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some may still consider the conditions to be quite onerous, particularly the disclosure related conditions,” said Raza Naeem, financial regulation partner at law firm Linklaters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FCA has stipulated, however, that the terms “sustainable”, “sustainability”, “impact”, and any play on those terms, must not be used in the names of products without labels. Its naming and marketing rules come into force on December 2, 2024.</span></p>\n<h3>Anti-greenwashing consultation</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FCA says its anti-greenwashing rules, meanwhile, will enter force in May 2024. Originally they were planned to coincide with the publication of its policy statement on SDR, but the regulator says the industry had asked for more time, given the possibility of “operational issues when trying to implement them alongside the rest of the SDR regime”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rules will apply to all communications regarding financial products or services that refer to their environmental or social attributes, with the intention of ensuring that sustainability-related claims are “fair, clear and not misleading”. The FCA consultation will run until January 26.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The fact the FCA is consulting on guidance for firms helps, but there will likely be a lot of nervousness among firms who will feel greater responsibility to make sure that any sustainability-related claims can be substantiated and do not omit or hide important information,” said Linklaters managing associate James Morris.</span></p>\n"

And there are allegations this is not the case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A whistleblower has leaked documents indicating COP28 president-designate Sultan al-Jaber's intent on using the UAE's role at the summit to push oil and gas deals with foreign governments, according to </span><a href=\"https://climate-reporting.org/cop28-president-oil-climate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an investigation by the Centre for Climate Reporting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with the BBC.

Now, it is reported that Jaber has held meetings with governments and business leaders, with plans to discuss fossil fuel deals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UAE has told the CCR and the BBC that “private meetings are private”. If that's the spirit that COP28 is going to be conducted with, then we're all going to spend the conference trying to figure out what “hasn't” been announced, putting little faith into what is agreed. The revelations have sparked outrage from climate leaders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“This is the 'Volkswagen 2015' moment for the #COP28 Presidency,” tweeted former </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Christiana Figueres, in reference to the German car giant's emissions scandal. “Caught red handed, the COP Presidency has no other option but to now unequivocally step up the transparency, responsibility and accountability with which they lead the process.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we can't trust the COP28 leadership to work appropriately with others on climate, regulators can at least do their bit to help companies collaborate on climate change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Philippa and I have a piece for you on how European and UK authorities are addressing fears over competition law </span><a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/how-europe-is-working-to-make-competition-law-more-sustainable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">restricting companies' abilities to work together on climate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The EU and the UK have both released guidance this year setting out exemptions for certain circumstances where it's better that businesses collaborate on climate, in recognition of issues such as “first-mover disadvantage” incurred when a company tries to become more sustainable on its own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elsewhere, Claudia has a yarn on </span><a href=\"https://www.sustainableviews.com/will-due-diligence-legislation-further-recalibrate-supply-chains/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">European due diligence legislation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
