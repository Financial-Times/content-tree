## Introduction

This document defines a format for representing Financial Times article content
as a tree. This specification is written in a
[typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)-like grammar, augmented by the
addition of the `external` property modifier.

The `external` property modifier indicates that the specified field is absent
when the `content-tree` is in
[**transit**](#what-does-it-mean-to-be-in-transit), and required when the
**content-tree** is at rest.

### What is `content-tree`?

`content-tree` extends [unist][unist], a format for syntax trees, to benefit
from its [ecosystem of utilities][unist-utilities].

`content-tree` relates to [JavaScript][js] in that it has an [ecosystem of
utilities][unist-utilities] for working with trees in JavaScript.  However,
`content-tree` is not limited to JavaScript and can be used in other programming
languages.

### How to use the types

We provide two namespaces in `content-tree.d.ts`, which is automatically
generated from this README. `ContentTree` and `ContentTree.transit`.

Install this repository as a dependency:

```sh notangle
npm install https://github.com/Financial-Times/content-tree
```

Use it in your code:

```ts notangle
import type {ContentTree} from "@financial-times/content-tree"

function makeBigNumber(): ContentTree.BigNumber {
	return {
		type: "|<tab>"
		        +--------------+
		        | "big-number" |
		        +--------------+
	}
}

function makeImageSetNoFixins(): ContentTree.transit.ImageSet {
	return {
		type: "image-set",
		id: string,
		// if you try to add a `picture` here it will get mad
	}
}
```

### What does it mean to be in transit?

When a `content-tree` is being rendered visually, external resources have been
fetched and added to the tree. When the `content-tree` is being transmitted
across the network, these external resources are referenced only by their `id`.

It is the state of the tree in the network that we call "in transit".

## Abstract Types

These abstract helper types define special types a [Parent](#parent) can use as
[children][term-child].

### `BodyBlock`

```ts
type BodyBlock =
	| Paragraph
	| Heading
	| ImageSet
	| Flourish
	| BigNumber
	| CustomCodeComponent
	| Layout
	| List
	| Blockquote
	| Pullquote
	| ScrollyBlock
	| ThematicBreak
	| Table
	| Recommended
	| Tweet
	| Video
	| YoutubeVideo
```

`BodyBlock` nodes are the only things that are valid as the top level of a `Body`.

### `LayoutWidth`

```ts
type LayoutWidth =
	| "auto"
	| "in-line"
	| "inset-left"
	| "inset-right"
	| "full-bleed"
	| "full-grid"
	| "mid-grid"
	| "full-width"
```

`LayoutWidth` defines how the component should be presented in the article page according to the column layout system.

### `Phrasing`

```ts
type Phrasing = Text | Break | Strong | Emphasis | Strikethrough | Link
```

A phrasing node cannot have ancestor of the same type.

i.e. a Strong will never be inside another Strong, or inside any other node that
is inside a Strong.

## Nodes

### `Node`

```ts
interface Node {
	type: string
	data?: any
}
```

The abstract node. The data field is for internal implementation information and
will never be defined in the content-tree spec.

### `Parent`

```ts
interface Parent extends Node {
	children: Node[]
}
```

**Parent** (**[UnistParent][term-parent]**) represents a node in content-tree
containing other nodes (said to be _[children][term-child]_).

Its content is limited to only other content-tree content.

### `Root`

```ts
interface Root extends Node {
	type: "root"
	body: Body
}
```

**Root** (**[Parent][term-parent]**) represents the root of a content-tree.

**Root** can be used as the _[root][term-root]_ of a _[tree][term-tree]_.

### `Body`

```ts
interface Body extends Parent {
	type: "body"
	version: number
	children: BodyBlock[]
}
```

**Body** (**[Parent][term-parent]**) represents the body of an article.

(note: `bodyTree` is just this part)

### `Text`

```ts
interface Text extends Node {
	type: "text"
	value: string
}
```

**Text** (**[Literal][term-literal]**) represents text.

### `Break`

```ts
interface Break extends Node {
	type: "break"
}
```

**Break** Node represents a break in the text, such as in a poem.

_Non-normative note: this would normally be represented by a `<br>` in the
html._

### `ThematicBreak`

```ts
interface ThematicBreak extends Node {
	type: "thematic-break"
}
```

**ThematicBreak** Node represents a break in the text, such as in a shift of
topic within a section.

_Non-normative note: this would be represented by an `<hr>` in the html._

### `Paragraph`

```ts
interface Paragraph extends Parent {
	type: "paragraph"
	children: Phrasing[]
}
```

Paragraph represents a unit of text.

### `Heading`

```ts
interface Heading extends Parent {
	type: "heading"
	children: Text[]
	level: "chapter" | "subheading" | "label"
}
```

**Heading** represents a unit of text that marks the beginning of an article
section.

### `Strong`

```ts
interface Strong extends Parent {
	type: "strong"
	children: Phrasing[]
}
```

**Strong** represents contents with strong importance, seriousness or urgency.

### `Emphasis`

```ts
interface Emphasis extends Parent {
	type: "emphasis"
	children: Phrasing[]
}
```

**Emphasis** represents stressed emphasis of its contents.

### `Strikethrough`

```ts
interface Strikethrough extends Parent {
	type: "strikethrough"
	children: Phrasing[]
}
```

**Strikethrough** represents a piece of text that has been stricken.

### `Link`

```ts
interface Link extends Parent {
	type: "link"
	url: string
	title: string
	children: Phrasing[]
}
```

**Link** represents a hyperlink.

### `List`

```ts
interface List extends Parent {
	type: "list"
	ordered: boolean
	children: ListItem[]
}
```

**List** represents a list of items.

### `ListItem`

```ts
interface ListItem extends Parent {
	type: "list-item"
	children: (Paragraph | Phrasing)[]
}
```

### `Blockquote`

```ts
interface Blockquote extends Parent {
	type: "blockquote"
	children: (Paragraph | Phrasing)[]
}
```

**Blockquote** represents a quotation.

### `Pullquote`

```ts
interface Pullquote extends Node {
	type: "pullquote"
	text: string
	source?: string
}
```

**Pullquote** represents a brief quotation taken from the main text of an
article.

_non normative note:_ the reason this is string properties and not children is
that it is more confusing if a pullquote falls back to text than if it
doesn't. The text is taken from elsewhere in the article.


### `ImageSet`

```ts
interface ImageSet extends Node {
	type: "image-set"
	id: string
	external picture: ImageSetPicture
}
```

#### Image types

##### `ImageSetPicture`

```ts
type ImageSetPicture = {
	layoutWidth: string
	imageType: "image" | "graphic"
	alt: string
	caption: string
	credit: string
	images: Image[]
	fallbackImage: Image
}
```

`ImageSetPicture` defines the data associated with an [ImageSet](#ImageSet)

##### `Image`

```ts
type Image = {
	id: string
	width: number
	height: number
	format:
		| "desktop"
		| "mobile"
		| "square"
		| "square-ftedit"
		| "standard"
		| "wide"
		| "standard-inline"
	url: string
	sourceSet?: ImageSource[]
}
```

`Image` defines a single use-case of a Picture[#ImageSetPicture].

### `ImageSource`

```ts
type ImageSource = {
	url: string
	width: number
	dpr: number
}
```

**ImageSource** defines a single resource for an [image](#image).


### `Recommended`


```ts
interface Recommended extends Node {
	type: "recommended"
	id: string
	heading?: string
	teaserTitleOverride?: string
	external teaser: Teaser
}
```

- Recommended represents a reference to an FT content that has been recommended
  by editorial.
- The `heading`, when present, is used where the purpose of the link is more
  specific than being "Recommended" (an example might be "In depth")
- The `teaserTitleOverride`, when present, is used in place of the content title
  of the link.

_non normative note:_ historically, recommended links used to be a list of up to
three content items. Testing later showed that having one more prominent link
was more engaging, and Spark (and therefore content-tree)now only supports that
use case.

#### Teaser types

These types were extracted from x-dash's
[x-teaser](https://github.com/Financial-Times/x-dash/blob/3408c268/components/x-teaser/Props.d.ts).

```ts
type TeaserConcept = {
	apiUrl: string
	directType: string
	id: string
	predicate: string
	prefLabel: string
	type: string
	types: string[]
	url: string
}

type Teaser = {
	id: string
	url: string
	type:
		| "article"
		| "video"
		| "podcast"
		| "audio"
		| "package"
		| "liveblog"
		| "promoted-content"
		| "paid-post"
	title: string
	publishedDate: string
	firstPublishedDate: string
	metaLink?: TeaserConcept
	metaAltLink?: TeaserConcept
	metaPrefixText?: string
	metaSuffixText?: string
	indicators: {
		accessLevel: "premium" | "subscribed" | "registered" | "free"
		isOpinion?: boolean
		isColumn?: boolean
		isPodcast?: boolean
		isEditorsChoice?: boolean
		isExclusive?: boolean
		isScoop?: boolean
	}
	image: {
		url: string
		width: number
		height: number
	}
}
```


### `Tweet`

```ts
interface Tweet extends Node {
	id: string
	type: "tweet"
	external html: string
}
```

**Tweet** represents a tweet.

### `Flourish`

```ts
interface Flourish extends Node {
	type: "flourish"
	id: string
	layoutWidth: string
	flourishType: string
	description?: string
	timestamp?: string
	fallbackImage?: Image
}
```

**Flourish** represents a flourish chart.

### `BigNumber`

```ts
interface BigNumber extends Node {
	type: "big-number"
	number: string
	description: string
}
```

**BigNumber** represents a big number.

### `Video`

```ts
interface Video extends Node {
	type: "video"
	id: string
	embedded: boolean
}
```

**Video** represents for an FT video referenced by a URL.

TODO: Figure out how Clips work, how they are different?

### `YoutubeVideo`

```ts
interface YoutubeVideo extends Node {
	type: "youtube-video"
	url: string
}
```

**YoutubeVideo** represents a video referenced by a Youtube URL.

### `ScrollyBlock`

```ts
interface ScrollyBlock extends Parent {
	type: "scrolly-block"
	theme: "sans" | "serif"
	children: ScrollySection[]
}
```

**ScrollyBlock** represents a block for telling stories through scroll position.

### `ScrollySection`

```ts
interface ScrollySection extends Parent {
	type: "scrolly-section"
	display: "dark-background" | "light-background"
	noBox?: true,
	position: "left" | "center" | "right"
	transition?: "delay-before" | "delay-after"
	children: [ScrollyImage, ...ScrollyCopy[]]
}
```

**ScrollySection** represents a section of a [ScrollyBlock](#scrollyblock)

### `ScrollyImage`

```ts
interface ScrollyImage extends Node {
	type: "scrolly-image"
	id: string
	external picture: ImageSetPicture
}
```

**ScrollyImage** represents an image contained in a [ScrollySection](#scrollysection)

### `ScrollyCopy`

```ts
interface ScrollyCopy extends Parent {
	type: "scrolly-copy"
	children: (ScrollyHeading | Paragraph)[]
}
```

**ScrollyCopy** represents a collection of **ScrollyHeading** or **Paragraph** nodes.

```ts
interface ScrollyHeading extends Parent {
	type: "scrolly-heading"
	level: "chapter" | "heading" | "subheading"
	children: Text[]
}
```

**ScrollyHeading** represents a heading within a **ScrollyCopy** block.

### `Layout`

```ts
interface Layout extends Parent {
	   type: "layout"
	   layoutName: "auto" | "card" | "timeline"
	   layoutWidth: string
	   children: [Heading, LayoutImage, ...LayoutSlot[]] | [Heading, ...LayoutSlot[]] | LayoutSlot[]
}
```

**Layout** nodes are a generic component used to display a combination of other
nodes (headings, images and paragraphs) in a visually distinctive way.

The `layoutName` acts as a sort of theme for the component.

### `LayoutSlot`


```ts
interface LayoutSlot extends Parent {
	type: "layout-slot"
	children: (Heading | Paragraph | LayoutImage)[]
}
```

A **Layout** can contain a number of **LayoutSlots**, which can be arranged
visually

_Non-normative note_: typically these would be displayed as flex items, so they
would appear next to each other taking up equal width.

### `LayoutImage`

```ts
interface LayoutImage extends Node {
	type: "layout-image"
	id: string
	alt: string
	caption: string
	credit: string
	external picture: ImageSetPicture
}
```

- **LayoutImage** is a workaround to handle pre-existing articles that were
  published using `<img>` tags rather than `<ft-content>` images. The reason for
  this was that in the bodyXML, layout nodes were inside an `<experimental>`
  tag, and that didn't support publishing `<ft-content>`.

### `Table`

```ts
type TableColumnSettings = {
	hideOnMobile: boolean
	sortable: boolean
	sortType: 'text' | 'number' | 'date' | 'currency' | 'percent'
}

interface TableCaption extends Parent {
	type: 'table-caption'
	children: Phrasing[]
}

interface TableCell extends Parent {
   type: 'table-cell'
	heading?: boolean
	children: Phrasing[]
}

interface TableRow extends Parent {
	type: 'table-row'
	children: TableCell[]
}

interface TableBody extends Parent {
	type: 'table-body'
	children: TableRow[]
}

interface TableFooter extends Parent {
	type: 'table-footer'
	children: Phrasing[]
}

interface Table extends Parent {
	type: 'table'
	stripes: boolean
	compact: boolean
	layoutWidth:
		| 'auto'
		| 'full-grid'
		| 'inset-left'
		| 'inset-right'
		| 'full-bleed'
	collapseAfterHowManyRows?: number
	responsiveStyle: 'overflow' | 'flat' | 'scroll'
	children: [TableCaption, TableBody, TableFooter] | [TableCaption, TableBody] | [TableBody, TableFooter] | [TableBody]
	columnSettings: TableColumnSettings[]
}
```

**Table** represents 2d data.

### CustomCodeComponent

```ts
type CustomCodeComponentAttributes = {
    [key: string]: string | boolean | undefined
}

interface CustomCodeComponent extends Node {
  /** Component type */
  type: "custom-code-component"
  /** Id taken from the CAPI url */
  id: string
  /** How the component should be presented in the article page according to the column layout system */
  layoutWidth: LayoutWidth
  /** Repository for the code of the component in the format "[github org]/[github repo]/[component name]". */
  external path: string
  /** Semantic version of the code of the component, e.g. "^0.3.5". */
  external versionRange: string
  /** Last date-time when the attributes for this block were modified, in ISO-8601 format. */
  external attributesLastModified: string
  /** Configuration data to be passed to the component. */
  external attributes: CustomCodeComponentAttributes
}
```

- The **CustomCodeComponent*** allows for more experimental forms of journalism, allowing editors to provide properties via Spark.
- The component itself lives off-platform, and an example might be a git repository with a standard structure. This structure would include the rendering instructions, and the data structure that is expected to be provided to the component for it to render if necessary.
- The basic interface in Spark to make reference to this system above (eg. the git repo URL or a public S3 bucket), and provide some data for it if necessary. This will be the Custom Component storyblock.
- The data Spark receives from entering a specific ID will be used to render dynamic fields (the `attributes`).
